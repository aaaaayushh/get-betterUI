# Get Better - A social media application that doesn't ruin your mental health(unheard of, I know)

Building a social media application from scratch is no easy task; designing everything from the frontend to the databases takes a lot of time.

But, after a lot of hard work, I'm proud to present a working prototype of a social media application that I built entirely on my own! There is a lot of work left on this application and I'll try my best to keep updating it with time, hopefully one day making it feasible to be used in the real world.

This repository is for the frontend side of the application, built entirely using React.js

The live version can be found here: https://fabulous-cactus-b629a1.netlify.app/

## Bugs

I am aware of the plethora of bugs that are _bugging_(hehe) this application and I will do my best to resolve them as soon as possible.
I'll list down the ones that I'm planning to prioritise solving

- Picture upload does not work(issue with Google Cloud payments may take some time to sort)

## List of Improvements

While I'm here, I'll list down a list of improvements that I want to make/features I want to add to this application in the future

- Migrate from Javascript to Typescript
- Migrate from React.js to Next.js(basically, make this site fast)
- Integrate functionality to upload multiple pictures in one post
- Integrate functionality to upload videos
- Integrate login with Github, other social media applications(you know, the ones that ruin your mental health)
- Write proper test cases on cypress.
- Threads for the comment section.
- Implement debouncing for the search users functionality(duh! don't know how I forgot to do this)
- The icing on this cake - the delicious, thick, chocolatey, mouth-watering icing, my very own machine-learning model, is not deployed yet. I'm figuring out a way to do it on AWS but unfortunately, it's going to take a while. So, the Get-Better functionality on the Get-Better social media application is not ready yet. Go figure.

Here's a preview of the landing page, let me know if you like the design!
